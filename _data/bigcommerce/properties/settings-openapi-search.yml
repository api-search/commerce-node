        **Usage Notes**


        Contextual filters allow you to configure the enabled filters per
        channel or category, so that shoppers can filter by the most relevant
        criteria.


        The order of the returned filters will match the sort order of the
        filters on the storefront.

        The endpoint does not support partial updates. Provide all fields to
        update global or channel-level settings.


        Create channel-level settings, or overrides for a channel, using the
        `channel_id`  query parameter. 


        To delete overrides for a channel, supply `null` as a value for all
        fields. A channel then inherits global values.


        The endpoint does not support 'null' as a value for global-level
        settings.
