        Use this endpoint to create a payment access token. A payment access
        token is required to process payments with the BigCommerce API.


        You can also generate a payment access token during checkout by using
        the `completeCheckout` mutation in the [GraphQL Storefront
        API](/docs/storefront/cart-checkout/guide/graphql-storefront#handling-payments).


        After the token is created, use the token to [Process a
        payment](/docs/rest-payments/processing#process-payment).
