        This feed request sets up and maintains items in bulk. 


        Use the relevant feed file type and review the feed file structure
        overview provided in the <a
        href="https://developer.walmart.com/doc/us/us-supplier/us-supplier-items/"
        target="_blank">Items Guide</a>. 


        Once the feed file is built, pass the attached file using the **Supplier
        Feed** request. Select the relevant product type, category, or supply
        chain item type as part of the submission process. For example, if
        setting up a Blu-ray disc&trade;, use the **Movies** product type to
        define all of the required attributes.


        This is an asynhronous (async) request, or a web service where users can
        carry out multiple requests simultaneously. Receiving a success response
        does not mean the feed file is processed successfully. Continue to track
        the status of the feed file by its `feedId` received from the **Feed
        Status** request.

        <baseUrl>/v2/feeds</a>


        This request adds rich media, or material such as videos, comparison
        tables, and item-specific view 360 media, to an item. 


        Extract the XSDs for the Rich Media API at the following link:


        <a
        href="https://developer.walmart.com/image/asdp/us/cp/Rich_Media_XSDs.zip">Rich
        Media API XSDs</a>


        Rich media can be uploaded only as an update for an item which has
        already been ingested. 


        New item uploads containing rich media will cause that item ingestion to
        fail. To upload rich media, the user must wait for the item ingestion
        process to complete successfully, then make a POST call with the rich
        media content for ingested items.

        This request displays a list of all items. 


        If the complete number of items exceeds the limit of items returned in a
        single request, the full list can be retrieved by subsequent requests
        using the `nextCursor` pagination mechanism.  


        If a stock keeping unit (SKU) is included in the request as a query
        parameter, the response will only return the SKU in redefined format.

                              Temporary tattoos are decorative images that can
                              be applied to the skin for short periods of time.
                              Most temporary tattoos are novelty items made with
                              a special type of decal. A process known as screen
                              printing is used to create the tattoo image on
                              paper coated with a transfer film. The transfer
                              film allows the image to ""slide"" off the backing
                              paper and onto the skin when moisture is applied.
                              After drying, the film holds the image on the skin
                              through several washings.;Another form of ink used

                              a few days, then gradually wear off by way of
                              exfoliation, typically within one to three weeks.

                              involves the use of chemicals to break and reform
                              the bonds of the hair. The hair is washed and
                              wrapped on a perm rod and waving lotion is applied
                              with a base.      ;This solution creates a
                              chemical reaction that softens the inner structure
                              of the hair by breaking some of the cross links
                              within and between the protein chains of the hair.
                              The hair swells, stretches and softens, then molds
                              around the shape of the perm rod.  The perming
                              chemicals consist of perm solution/waving lotion
                              and a neutralizer.;A texturizer is a chemical
                              process that smooths and de-frizzes your hair
                              while maintaining some of your natural curls. It

                              it. Loosening the curl allows for more

                              manageability. Texturizers are ideal for someone

                              determine the time in the menstrual cycle when
                              getting pregnant is most likely. The test detects
                              a rise in luteinizing hormone (LH) in the urine. A
                              rise in this hormone signals the ovary to release
                              the egg. Fertility testing is the process by which
                              fertility is assessed, both generally and also to
                              find the "fertile window" in the menstrual cycle.

                              The process works by inserting an epilator device
                              into the skin's hair follicles. It uses shortwave

                              handheld fans are folding fans, which are shaped
                              like a sector of a circle and made of a thin
                              material (such as paper or feathers) mounted on

                              be closed when not in use. Hand fans were used
                              before mechanical fans were invented.

                              A tattoo gun is a machine that is a hand-held
                              device generally used to create a tattoo, a
                              permanent marking of the skin with indelible ink.
                              Modern tattoo machines use electromagnetic coils
                              to move an armature bar up and down. Connected to
                              the armature bar is a barred needle grouping that
                              pushes ink into the skin. Tattoo artists generally
                              use the term "machine", "pen", or even "iron", to
                              refer to their equipment, and the word "gun" is
                              also occasionally used. In addition to "coiled"
                              tattoo machines, there are also rotary tattoo
                              machines, which are powered by regulated motors
                              rather than electromagnetic coils. The basic
                              machine is pretty much unchanged today, in recent
                              years variations of the theme have crept into the
                              market, namely Manfred Kohr’s Rotary machine of
                              1976 or Carson Hill’s pneumatic machine that uses
                              compressed air rather than electricity, but the
                              principle is essentially the same.

                              A digital signal processor (DSP) is a specialized
                              microprocessor chip, with its architecture
                              optimized for the operational needs of digital
                              signal processing.  DSPs are fabricated on MOS
                              integrated circuit chips. They are widely used in
                              audio signal processing, telecommunications,
                              digital image processing, radar, sonar and speech
                              recognition systems, and in common consumer
                              electronic devices such as mobile phones, disk
                              drives and high-definition television (HDTV)
                              products.;

                              The goal of a DSP is usually to measure, filter or
                              compress continuous real-world analog signals.
                              Most general-purpose microprocessors can also
                              execute digital signal processing algorithms
                              successfully, but may not be able to keep up with
                              such processing continuously in real-time. Also,
                              dedicated DSPs usually have better power
                              efficiency, thus they are more suitable in
                              portable devices such as mobile phones because of
                              power consumption constraints. DSPs often use
                              special memory architectures that are able to
                              fetch multiple data or instructions at the same
                              time.

                              lure, usually used in the sport of fly fishing
                              (although they may also be used in other forms of
                              angling). In general, artificial flies are an
                              imitation of natural food sources that fly fishers
                              present to their target species of fish while fly
                              fishing. Artificial flies are constructed by fly
                              tying, in which furs, feathers, thread or any of
                              very many other materials are tied onto a fish
                              hook.[1] Artificial flies may be constructed to
                              represent all manner of potential freshwater and
                              saltwater fish prey to include aquatic and

                              flies because of their ability to put fish in the
                              creel for the fly fisher. There are thousands of

                              underwater seat in the "hole." Still, modern

                              side and the seat raised above the water allowing
                              the legs of the angler to be the only part of the

                              many aspects of fishing, such as flyfishing for
                              trout or lure fishing for largemouth bass, and

                              fishing line, it can serve several purposes.
                              Firstly, it can suspend the bait at a
                              predetermined depth; secondly, due to its
                              buoyancy, it can carry the baited hook to
                              otherwise inaccessible areas of water by allowing
                              the float to drift in the prevailing current; and
                              thirdly, a float also serves as a visual bite
                              indicator. Fishing with a float is sometimes
                              called float fishing.

                              the end that is used to stab a large fish and then
                              lift the fish into the boat or onto shore.
                              Ideally, the hook is placed under the backbone.
                              Gaffs are used when the weight of the fish exceeds
                              the breaking point of the fishing line or the
                              fishing pole. A gaff cannot be used if it is
                              intended to release the fish unharmed after
                              capture, unless the fish is skilfully gaffed in
                              the lip, jaw, or lower gill using a thin gaff

                              A fish hook or fishhook is a tool for catching
                              fish either by impaling them in the mouth or, more
                              rarely, by snagging the body of the fish. Fish
                              hooks have been employed for centuries by anglers
                              to catch fresh and saltwater fish. In 2005, the
                              fish hook was chosen by Forbes as one of the top
                              twenty tools in the history of man.[1] Fish hooks
                              are normally attached to some form of line or lure
                              which connects the caught fish to the angler.
                              There is an enormous variety of fish hooks in the
                              world of fishing. Sizes, designs, shapes, and
                              materials are all variable depending on the
                              intended purpose of the fish hook. Fish hooks are
                              manufactured for a range of purposes from general
                              fishing to extremely limited and specialized
                              applications. Fish hooks are designed to hold
                              various types of artificial, processed, dead or
                              live baits (bait fishing); to act as the

                              A fishing net is a net used for fishing. Nets are
                              devices made from fibers woven in a grid-like
                              structure. Some fishing nets are also called fish
                              traps, for example fyke nets. Fishing nets are
                              usually meshes formed by knotting a relatively
                              thin thread. Early nets were woven from grasses,
                              flaxes and other fibrous plant material. Later
                              cotton was used. Modern nets are usually made of
                              artificial polyamides like nylon, although nets of
                              organic polyamides such as wool or silk thread
                              were common until recently and are still used.

                              A leader is simply a length of material (or
                              materials) that connects your fly line to your
                              fly. The object of a fly leader is pretty
                              straightforward – to connect your fly to your fly
                              line in a way that helps you catch fish. Sometimes
                              leaders are one piece, others are made by knotting
                              together shorter sections.  Tippet is a specific
                              gauge monofilament line that is attached to the
                              end of the leader, to which you tie the fly. The
                              tippet is usually the smallest gauge line on your
                              rig and is virtually invisible to the fish. Tippet
                              is also very flexible and allows your fly to float
                              or swim more naturally.

                              a hole drilled in the ice with an auger, and

                              does take the bait, a flag "tips up" or the flag
                              can "tip down" to signal the angler that a fish
                              has taken his bait. Because the angler does not
                              need to stay with his line and can see that the
                              flag at a distance, he or she is able to cover a

                              magazine functions by holding several cartridges
                              within itself and sequentially pushing each one

                              turning it increases or decreases tension in the

                              relative to the rim. Since spoke threading and
                              nipple threading must match, boxes of spokes
                              usually include a like number of nipples.

                              tip darts can be used on "bristle" dart boards
                              (the boards traditionally used with steel darts),
                              but you should never use steel tip darts on soft
                              tip dart boards as they will cause permanent
                              damage. Some dart points are removable while
                              others are permanently integrated into the barrel.
                              Darts can also have either fixed points or
                              moveable points. Moveable point darts are
                              constructed in a way that allows the points to
                              retract slightly into the barrels upon impact.
                              This slight retraction allows the dart to continue
                              its forward motion when hitting a hard surface,
                              such as the dart board's wire, sliding the point
                              past the wire into the dart board, virtually
                              eliminating bounce-outs.

                              flatter sole than a fairway wood.

                              Golf Irons are a type of golf club that have a
                              solid, all-metal head featuring a flat angled
                              face, and a shorter shaft and more upright lie
                              angle than a wood, for ease of access. Most of the
                              irons have a number from 1 to 9 (the numbers in
                              most common use are from 3 to 9), corresponding to
                              their relative loft angle within a matched set.
                              Irons are typically grouped according to their
                              intended distance (which also roughly corresponds
                              to their shaft length and thus their difficulty to
                              hit the ball); in the numbered irons, there are
                              long irons (2–4), medium irons (5–7), and short
                              irons (8–9), with progressively higher loft
                              angles, shorter shafts, and heavier club heads.

                              Golf Putters are a special class of clubs with a
                              loft not exceeding ten degrees, designed primarily
                              to roll the ball along the grass, generally from a
                              point on the putting green toward the hole.
                              Contrary to popular belief, putters do have a loft
                              (often 5° from truly perpendicular at impact) that
                              helps to lift the ball from any indentation it has
                              made. Newer putters also include grooves on the
                              face to promote roll rather than a skid off the
                              impact.

                              A Pet Crate is usually a box-shaped container or
                              cage that has openings for airflow and that is
                              used for temporarily confining or carrying animals
                              (such as dogs or cats). They are typically used
                              indoors and should only be a little bigger than
                              the pet's size, providing a sense of safety and
                              security. Small crates or kennels can be used to
                              transport pets for travel.

                              A Pet Kennel, which is much bigger than a crate,
                              is a semi-permanent outdoor structure used to
                              house and shelter pets. Animals can spend a
                              majority of time in their kennels, since they are
                              big enough to sleep, move around, play, or run in.

                              always closed, which prevents bees from getting to
                              the food source the guard is there to protect.
                              These are most commonly used in hummingbird
                              feeders, so that the nectar/sugar water stays
                              protected from bees, while simultaneously allowing
                              hummingbirds to stick their beaks inside and gain
                              access to the food source. Bee Guards prevent
                              bees, hornets, flies and larger birds from
                              polluting or wasting nectar.

                              Bird Feeder Domes & Baffles are protective shields
                              for outdoor bird feeders. These bird feeder
                              accessories are typically round, strong plastic
                              domes to be mounted atop a bird feeder, or below
                              it, on a pole. It is a contraption used to stop
                              squirrels from climbing up a bird feeder pole or
                              jumping down directly onto a feeder from above. A
                              dome installed on top of the bird feeder also acts
                              like an umbrella to keep the bird seeds dry in the
                              rain.

                              Domes are hemispherical. 

                              Baffles are typically shaped like an upside down
                              cone, plate, tube, wall or screen.

                              These items are commonly known as Squirrel Guards,
                              because they are mainly used to keep squirrels
                              away from bird feeders.

                              Bark Control Training Aids are products that are
                              designed to control, reduce or eliminate a dog's
                              barking. There are 2 main types:* Small, handheld
                              devices with transmitters, or stationary items
                              that are placed in the dog's living or playing
                              area. These devices emit an ultrasonic sound to
                              disrupt the dog and stop it from barking.;* Bark
                              control collars that correct barking behavior. The
                              corrective sound, spray or shock happens when the
                              collar detects barking, either through the sound
                              of the bark, or the movement of the vocal cords in
                              the neck area. These are NOT controlled by the pet
                              owner with a remote. There are 3 main types of
                              bark collars:1. Ultrasonic Collars, which emit a
                              safe, high-pitched sound that only a dog can
                              hear;2. Spray Collars, which spray a mist like
                              citronella;3. Shock Collars, which use an
                              electrode to shock the dog;NOTE:1. Does not

                              ;*Electronic collars usually include a collar with
                              a receiver, as well as a remote control. When the
                              button on the remote is pressed, it sends a radio
                              signal to the receiver, triggering some type of

                              collars inflict discomfort when tightened. The

                              distracts the pet to stop it from doing the
                              unwanted behavior. These include choke and prong

                              wires used as a tension device in reinforced
                              concrete and reinforced masonry structures to
                              strengthen and aid the concrete under tension.
                              Concrete is strong under compression, but has weak
                              tensile strength. Rebar significantly increases
                              the tensile strength of the structure. Rebar's
                              surface is often "deformed" with ribs, lugs or
                              indentations to promote a better bond with the
                              concrete and reduce the risk of slippage.

                              eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from
                              dairy milk or cream and is flavoured with a
                              sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and any
                              spice, such as cocoa or vanilla.

                              Sorbet or sherbet is a frozen dessert made from
                              sugar-sweetened water with flavoring – typically
                              fruit juice, fruit purée, wine, liqueur or honey.
                              The terminology is not settled, but generally
                              sorbets do not contain dairy ingredients, while
                              sherbets do.

                              Frozen yogurt is a frozen dessert made with yogurt
                              and sometimes other dairy and non-dairy products.
                              Frozen yogurt is a frozen product containing the
                              same basic ingredients as ice cream, but contains
                              live bacterial cultures".

                              live in crevices or burrows on the sea floor.
                              Three of their five pairs of legs have claws,
                              including the first pair, which are usually much
                              larger than the others.

                              also less nutritious and laced with questionable
                              additives.

                              just a few round holes that you scrape along the
                              fruit. A grater, on the other hand, is

                      Indicates the item must ship by itself and not with
                      another item in the same box.


                      If `YES`, the item must ship by itself and not with
                      another item in the same box. The item will not be grouped
                      for ship price calculation.


                      If `NO`, the item can be shipped with another item in the
                      same box.

                      The value is in cases for grocery and each for hardlines.
                      Hardlines are defined as consumer durables and can usually
                      be distinguished in a retailer's inventory by whether they
                      come in boxes.


                      In hardlines, the minimum order quantity must be a
                      multiple of warehouse pack quantity. This is the quantity
                      of the item that comes into the warehouse.


                      Example:<br>

                            Body spray is a perfume or cologne product, similar
                            to aerosol deodorant, which is intended to be used
                            elsewhere on the body besides the armpits. Body
                            sprays are lighter in strength than cologne,
                            generally less expensive, and double as deodorant a
                            body spray is just a milder form of perfume. Body
                            spray is a mixture of water and alcohol along with
                            various extracts.  Body Sprays will also often be
                            called Body Mists or Hair Mists.  The Body Sprays
                            product type includes Body Spray bundles, multi
                            sets, and gift sets, as long as they don't contain
                            perfume or cologne.
