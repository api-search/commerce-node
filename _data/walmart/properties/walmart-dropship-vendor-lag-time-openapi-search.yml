        This request updates the lag time for items in bulk. Lag time is the
        number of days between when an item is ordered and when it is shipped. 

        This feature is only available for select drop ship vendor (DSV)
        suppliers. 

        For more on how to request permission, see the guide overview.


        Two versions of this feed type exist:


        * v2.x: Uses global trade item number (GTIN) as the primary item
        identifier (JSON only). Suppliers can update lag time of multiple items
        across multiple nodes.

        * v1.0: Uses the stock keeping unit (SKU) as the primary item identifier
        (XML and JSON). v1.0 is in the process of being deprecated.

            type: string
          description: |
            Specifies the type of the feed content.

            Use `lagtime` for this request.

          description: >
            Specifies the distribution facility distributor identifier.


            This parameter is used in v1.0 and not used in v2.x.


            This parameter identifies each facility from which the inventory is
            requested. 

            The identifier is autogenerated during drop ship vendor (DSV)
            account creation. 

            Every time users add or update a facility in Supplier Center, a new
            identifier is generated.

            Ensure this value is up to date.

                          This parameter can only be a global trade item number
                          (GTIN).


                          The global trade item number (GTIN) is a 14-digit
                          number, including the check digit, that is used
                          worldwide and identifies the Each. If the user's
                          number is less than 14 digits, add zeros at the
                          beginning.

                          Specifies the distribution facility distributor
                          identifier.


                          This parameter identifies each facility from which the
                          lag time is requested. 

                          The identifier is autogenerated during drop ship
                          vendor (DSV) account creation. 

                          Every time users add or update a facility in Supplier
                          Center, a new identifier is generated. 

                          Ensure this value is up to date.


                          Example(s):<br>

                        description: >
                          Specifies fulfillment lag time.


                          Fulfillment lag time is the maximum number of days it
                          takes suppliers to process an order for shipment.


                          Assigning lag times helps suppliers manage when orders
                          are expected to ship to the customer.

        This request retrieves the lag time for an item with a given product
        identifier—such as a stock keeping unit (SKU) or global trade item
        number (GTIN)—and ship node. 

        Lag time is the number of days between when an item is ordered and when
        it is shipped.


        Drop ship vendor (DSV) suppliers are expected to ship items the day they
        receive the purchase order (PO). 

        In certain exceptions, those suppliers can have items with extended lag
        times. 

        Use GET /v3/lagtim to see the lag time of an item at a node.

                  This parameter can only be a global trade item number (GTIN).


                  The global trade item number (GTIN) is a 14-digit number,
                  including the check digit, that is used worldwide and
                  identifies the Each. If the user's number is less than 14
                  digits, add zeros at the beginning.

                  Specifies the distribution facility distributor identifier.


                  This parameter identifies each facility from which the lag
                  time is requested. 

                  The identifier is autogenerated during drop ship vendor (DSV)
                  account creation. 

                  Every time users add or update a facility in Supplier Center,
                  a new identifier is generated. 

                  Ensure this value is up to date.

                description: >
                  Specifies fulfillment lag time.


                  Fulfillment lag time is the maximum number of days it takes
                  suppliers to process an order for shipment.


                  Assigning lag times helps suppliers manage when orders are
                  expected to ship to the customer.
