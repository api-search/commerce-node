        This request allows consumers to ship one or more purchase order (PO)
        lines. 


        For Site to Store (S2S) orders, package and pallet advance ship notices
        (ASN) need to be included in the request payload.


        Changing the status of order lines to `Shipped` triggers a charge to the
        customer. 

        In order to avoid underselling, orders must be acknowledged before
        sending a shipping update. 

        Once an order line is marked as shipped, it cannot be updated.


        Note: `shipDateTime` must be in UTC.


        The response to a successful call contains the order with the shipped
        line item.

            Specifies an identifier associated with the purchase order.

            This value is used to query a purchase order.

            Specifies the distribution facility distributor identifier.


            This parameter identifies each facility from which the inventory is
            requested. The identifier is autogenerated during drop ship vendor
            (DSV) account creation. Every time users add or update a facility in
            Supplier Center, a new identifier is generated. Ensure this value is
            up to date.

            Supplier Center, a new identifier is generated. Ensure this value is
            up to date.

        <walmartAuthServerUrl>/v3/orders/{purchaseOrderId}/acknowledge</p>


        This request allows a drop ship vendor (DSV) to acknowledge an order,
        including all order lines, preferably within four hours of receipt of
        the order.


        The response to a successful call contains the acknowledged order. 

        As a good practice, acknowledge orders to avoid underselling.


        Only those orders that are in a `Created` state should be acknowledged. 

        Orders that are in an `Acknowledged` state can be re-acknowledged. 

        This is desirable, for example, when resolving an error response from a
        previous API call. 

        Orders with line items that are shipped or canceled should not be
        re-acknowledged.

            This parameter identifies each facility from which the inventory is
            requested. The identifier is autogenerated during drop ship vendor
            (DSV) account creation. Every time users add or update a facility in
            Supplier Center, a new identifier is generated. Ensure this value is
            up to date.

        This request retrieves details of all the orders for specified search
        criteria.


        The search only retrieves orders created in last 180 days.

            Specifies the distribution facility distributor identifier.


            This parameter identifies each facility from which the inventory is
            requested. 

            The identifier is autogenerated during drop ship vendor (DSV)
            account creation. 

            Every time users add or update a facility in Supplier Center, a new
            identifier is generated. 

            Ensure this value is up to date.

        This request retrieves all the orders with line items in `Created`
        status.


        These orders have been released from the Walmart Order Management System
        (OMS) to the supplier for processing. 

        Released orders are ready for supplier fulfillment.


        Only orders created in last 180 days can be fetched, and a maximum of
        20,000 orders can be fetched and downloaded at a time. 

        Attempting to download more than 20,000 orders will return an error.

            Specifies the distribution facility distributor identifier.


            This parameter identifies each facility from which the inventory is
            requested. 

            The identifier is autogenerated during drop ship vendor (DSV)
            account creation. 

            Every time users add or update a facility in Supplier Center, a new
            identifier is generated. 

            Ensure this value is up to date.
