  eBay offers developers a wide range of RESTful and Traditional APIs. For new
  development, eBay strongly encourages the use of our RESTful APIs. A key
  benefit of REST is that it uses less bandwidth and supports multiple formats
  including plain text, XML, HTML, and JSON while SOAP only supports XML.

      Use the Taxonomy API to discover the most appropriate eBay categories
      under which sellers can offer inventory items for sale, and the most
      likely categories under which buyers can browse or search for items to
      purchase. In addition, the Taxonomy API provides metadata about the
      required and recommended category aspects to include in listings, and also
      has two operations to retrieve parts compatibility information.

      The Translation API provides machine translation to help bring inventory
      to new markets. The Translation API translates common commerce content,
      such as the title of an item to help present marketplace listings to
      buyers in different countries or regions. The Translation API takes
      foreign language search queries from the buyer and translates them for the
      target marketplace, as well.

    description: >-
      The Client Registration API provides Dynamic Client Registration for
      regulated Third Party Providers (TPPs) who are, or will be, engaged in
      financial transactions on behalf of individuals domiciled in the EU/UK.

      (ASPSPs) to provide secure APIs to access account and payment services on
      behalf of account holders.
